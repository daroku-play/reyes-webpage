 <h1>My Mates</h1>
<p>I have quite a lot of mates that I have met from having similar interests, for example :</p>
<h1>The Robotic Gang</h1>
<p>

<p>I have known mostly everyone from the robotics gang because class Proaktif and Optimis have physical education class together, but all of us started hanging out more often after we went to a robitics competition in Perak in June of 2018. We spent 3 hours in the bus just chatting together. After that competition, we joined a lot more competitions together.</p>

<h1>The Provectors Gang</h1>
<p>

</p>
<p>My mates that I have been known since Form 1 because class Proaktif does not change students every year unlike other classes. They never give me up, they never let me down, they never run around and desert me. I look forward to being with them for 2 more years.</p>

<h1>The SK Trio Gang</h1>
<p><img width="340" height="480" src="trio.jpg"></p>
<p>We started to hang out after we were called to join a scarbble competition together in Standard 6. We lost :( but after that we started hanging out a lot out of school. We usually meet up to watch a movie or play laser tag. In fact. we even hang out to this day.</p>

<h1>The Drip Gang</h1>
<p>
<img width="480" height="270" src="drip.jpg">
</p>
<p>We are (probably) the 3 most active people on Discord in the Provectors Discord server. We play <b>s lot</b> of games together. When one of us starts playing a new game, the other two will start playing the same game. We tend to play a lot of multiplayer games such as Minecraft and Genshin Impact because of that. We have actually known eachother since "sekolah agama" but only started playing games together during the MCO period.</p>
