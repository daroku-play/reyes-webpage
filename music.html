 <h1>My Music</h1>
<p>I mostly like to listen to Japanese songs but sometimes I even listen to K-pop songs and western songs that I like. I like songs that either have a really fast beat or a really slow beat, not anywhere in the middle. I like these types of songs because they give a sense of motivation to get things done. This is the playlist of songs i listen to when doing my homework or just playing games.</p>

</p>

<p>I like Konomi Suzuki because she does the vocals for a lot of Re:Zero songs and Re:Zero is one of my favourite shows so I like anything that comes from it. On the other hand, I like Yoh Kamiyama and Kiro Akiyama because their songs have fast beats and makes me feels relaxed and motivated at the same time.</p>
