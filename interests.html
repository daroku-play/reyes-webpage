<h1>My Interests</h1>
<p>I have a few interests such as gaming and coding</p>

<h1>Gaming</h1>
<p>I play games such as Mobile Legends, Minecraft, Genshin Impact and many more. I mostly play with my mates from squad Provectors. We usually play around 10pm onwards until we feel tired :v. We also joined quite a few tournaments during the MCO. Sadly, we didn't win any but I still enjoyed playing with my mates because we can always try again in other tournaments.</p>

<h1>Coding</h1>

<p>I only got into coding during June of last year. I was fascinated by the many things bots could do on Discord such as play music, minigames and even set reminders. I was bored one day and decided to watch a tutorial on how to make a Discord bot. I quickly learned the javascript coding language and started making the bot. After pulling an all-nighter, i finished a basic bot that me and my mates can use. Over time, I've added many more features to make our lives easier. My end goal is to make a bot that can do so many things that it replaces every other bot on Discord.</p>

<h1>Learning more code</h1>
<p>I decided to learn more coding languages such as html and css. I also watched a few videos on cloud computing which is basically running your code online so that it can stay active 24/7. I used a Github <a href="https://github.com/daroku-play"><u>repository</u></a> for this and ran the code on a free website. A few of my projects are the Discord Bot, this website that you are currently reading, and a simple game that you can play <a href="game.html"><u>here</u></a></p>
